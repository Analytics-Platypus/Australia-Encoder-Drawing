Neural Network for Target Encoding
This script trains a neural network to encode input data into a target representation. The network is highly customizable via command-line arguments, allowing users to define the input data, the target encoding, and various training parameters. Below is a detailed explanation of how the script executes:

Execution Overview
Command-Line Arguments
The script accepts several command-line arguments to configure the training process:

--target: Specifies the target encoding (input, star16, or aus26).
--dim: Sets the input dimension for one-hot encoding.
--plot: Enables intermediate plotting of the network's hidden layer during training.
--epochs: Maximum number of training epochs.
--stop: Loss value at which training stops.
--lr: Learning rate for the optimizer.
--mom: Momentum value for the optimizer.
--init: Standard deviation for the random initialization of weights.
--cuda: Enables GPU computation if available.
Example:

bash
python train_encoder.py --target star16 --dim 16 --plot --epochs 5000 --cuda
Setting Up the Device
Based on the --cuda argument, the script determines whether to use a CPU or GPU for computations.

Loading Target Encodings
The script loads the target data based on the --target argument:

input: Identity matrix (one-hot encoding).
star16: Predefined star16 target encoding.
aus26: Predefined aus26 target encoding.
Input Preparation
The input is constructed as a one-hot encoding matrix with the same number of rows as the target matrix.

Data Loading
A torch.utils.data.DataLoader is created to handle the training data in batches.

Network Initialization
The neural network is defined using the EncModel class. Key features include:

A customizable architecture with an input layer, hidden layer (of size 2), and output layer.
Weights are initialized with a normal distribution (mean = 0, std = --init).
Biases are initialized to zero.
Training Loop

The training loop continues until the maximum number of epochs (--epochs) is reached or the loss falls below the specified threshold (--stop).
For each batch:
Compute the output of the network.
Calculate the binary cross-entropy loss between the output and the target.
Perform backpropagation to compute gradients.
Update the network's weights using the SGD optimizer.
Progress is logged every 10 epochs.
Intermediate Plotting (Optional)
If --plot is enabled, the script visualizes the hidden layer's activations at selected epochs using the plot_hidden function.

Final Visualization
After training, the script saves the final visualization of the hidden layer to australia.png and australia.jpg. The plot is also displayed if --plot is enabled.
